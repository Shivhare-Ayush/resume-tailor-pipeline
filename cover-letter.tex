Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the IT Data Integration internship at GM Financial (11-week program: May 27, 2026 — August 7, 2026). I am a B.S. Computer Science candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected graduation December 2026) and meet the internship's academic eligibility requirements.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with extraction, transformation, and loading processes and to support the Enterprise Data Warehouse. In prior projects I have processed and transformed datasets using SQL and Python, built repeatable data flows, and documented data-processing steps to improve accuracy and maintainability. I am comfortable writing unit-style checks, testing ETL behavior on sample data, and iterating on data formats to support downstream analysis.

I am particularly interested in your lab and experimentation work with batch and streaming technologies. I am eager to learn emerging data engineering tools, collaborate with data scientists and ETL developers, and help evaluate and demonstrate capabilities that accelerate adoption. I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail when shaping data, and clear written and verbal communication for documenting processes and presenting findings to stakeholders.

I am available for the entire internship period and able to work closely with the Arlington/DFW teams as required. Thank you for considering my application — I would welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to GM Financial's Data Integration team and can provide examples of recent data projects or references on request.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
