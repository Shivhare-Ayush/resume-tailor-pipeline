Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer internship within Oracle’s Global Industry Unit for the May–August 2026 program. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected graduation December 2026), am enrolled before and after the internship, and meet the eligibility criteria described in your posting.

Oracle’s focus on large-scale, industry-specific cloud applications strongly aligns with my experience and interests. I have hands-on experience implementing backend services and data pipelines using Java and Python, authored SQL for analytics and ETL, and built web frontends using JavaScript/HTML/CSS. In team projects I’ve designed modular services and containerized deployments (Docker), and I’ve experimented with orchestration and microservice patterns.

My coursework and projects cover Algorithms, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Design, Database systems, and Machine Learning — I have completed projects that apply these topics to practical problems (search, classification, and scalable data processing). I’m comfortable coding in multiple languages, writing unit and integration tests, and using container-based workflows to make development and deployment reproducible.

I’m particularly excited about working in a research-and-development oriented group: I enjoy evaluating new technologies, building small prototypes, and demonstrating their value to stakeholders. I can contribute immediately to coding projects, testing and debugging Oracle software, and collaborating in an agile environment while learning Oracle Cloud patterns.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the chance to discuss how my background in software engineering, data processing, and cloud-focused development fits the needs of Oracle GIU. I can provide a transcript, code samples, and references upon request.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
