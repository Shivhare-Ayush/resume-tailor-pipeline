Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express interest in the Sophomore Leadership Internship at GM Financial (8-week program: May 27, 2026 — July 17, 2026). I am excited by the opportunity to learn through job-shadowing, mentorship, and leadership-development workshops while exploring career paths in automotive finance.

Although your posting targets rising sophomores and juniors, I value the program's goals of observation, mentorship, and professional development. If my current academic level makes me ineligible for this particular cohort, I would appreciate consideration for other internship opportunities or a future cohort.

Why I am a strong match for the program:
- Curious and coachable: I seek opportunities to observe experienced practitioners and learn by doing and listening; I regularly participate in mentorship and technical workshops.
- Strong communicator and collaborator: I have presented technical work to mixed audiences, facilitated team planning sessions, and led peer mentoring activities.
- Leadership orientation: I have led engineering teams and organized workshops that built teammates' capabilities and improved delivery processes.
- Commitment to inclusion and learning: I welcome diverse perspectives and have supported inclusive team practices in project and club settings.

I am available for the full 8-week period, enthusiastic about in-person engagement, and eager to connect with leaders across GM Financial to learn more about finance, operations, and career paths. I can provide references and examples of projects or volunteer activities that demonstrate my curiosity, communication skills, and leadership potential.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the possibility of participating in GM Financial’s Sophomore Leadership Internship and gaining exposure to the many career paths your company offers.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
