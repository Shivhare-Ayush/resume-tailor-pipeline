Hiring Committee \\
CVS Health — Data Engineering Undergraduate internship \\
United States

\vspace{1em}

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Data Engineering Undergraduate internship (May 27 — August 7, 2026). I am a B.S. Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected December 2026) and eligible to work in the U.S. without visa sponsorship.

I am excited by CVS Health’s focus on large-scale analytics and building robust data pipelines. My recent work and coursework give me practical experience with the core skills you list: SQL and Python for data processing, cloud deployments on Google Cloud Platform, and ETL/streaming patterns. At Potion Cast I implemented backend data persistence and telemetry for a real-time conversational AI installation, building ingestion pipelines and SQL-based analytics to support event reporting. At Nebula Labs I helped design and deploy data pipelines that supported product telemetry for 20,000+ users and improved processing reliability by adding containerized deployments and CI/CD for data jobs.

I have experience with ETL design and have used Python for batch and near-real-time processing; I am familiar with Spark/PySpark concepts and have applied query optimization and data partitioning techniques to reduce aggregation time in project work. I enjoy partnering with analytics and product teams to translate requirements into reliable data flows and observability. Additionally, I’ve mentored student teams on scalable API design and CI/CD, which complements the internship’s mentorship and professional development components.

I am eager to contribute to designing and operating data pipelines, implementing data transformations, and deploying processing on GCP. I am available for the full internship period, comfortable with the hybrid schedule in Irving, TX (or other listed locations), and interested in exploring full-time opportunities at CVS Health after graduation. I can provide transcripts, code samples, and references upon request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
