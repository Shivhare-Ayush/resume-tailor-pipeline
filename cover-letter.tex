Hiring Committee \\
CVS Health — InnoTech Engineering Internship (Undergraduate) \\
United States

\vspace{1em}

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to apply for the InnoTech Engineering Internship (Undergraduate) for Summer 2026 (May 27 — August 7). I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected December 2026) and am eligible to work in the U.S. without visa sponsorship.

CVS Health’s InnoTech program attracts me because of its focus on applied engineering at enterprise scale and cross-functional delivery. My coursework and hands-on projects give me strong alignment with the role’s technical requirements: proficiency in Python and Java, experience with JavaScript/React and Node.js, familiarity with C++ concepts from systems coursework, solid SQL for data access, and practical use of GCP for deployments. At Potion Cast I implemented ingestion and telemetry pipelines for a real-time conversational AI installation, built SQL-based analytics for event reporting, and instrumented jobs for observability. At Nebula Labs I contributed to pipelines and platform reliability supporting 20,000+ users, introduced containerized deployments and CI/CD, and collaborated closely with product and analytics teams.

I’ve also worked on ETL patterns and data transformations in Python, and have exposure to Spark/PySpark concepts from project work. I mentor student teams on scalable API design, testing, and CI/CD, reflecting the leadership and communication skills the program values. I enjoy working iteratively with stakeholders, translating requirements into reliable, testable engineering work, and learning new tools to solve real problems.

I am available for the full internship period and comfortable with the hybrid schedule in Irving, TX (or other listed locations). I am enthusiastic about contributing to InnoTech projects—whether building internal tools, prototyping AI-enabled features, or improving platform delivery—and am interested in exploring full-time opportunities at CVS after graduation. I can provide transcripts, code samples, and references upon request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
