Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Product Owner internship at GM Financial (11-week program: May 27, 2026 — August 7, 2026). I am a B.S. Computer Science candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected graduation December 2026) and will have at least one semester remaining when the internship begins.

I am excited by the Product Owner responsibilities you describe — analyzing customer requirements, working with cross-functional teams, and using creative problem-solving to drive product improvements. In my roles leading engineering teams and coordinating releases, I regularly translated stakeholder needs into actionable plans, prioritized work to meet deadlines, and communicated progress to both technical and business audiences.

Relevant qualifications and fit:
- Agile experience: I participate in Agile/Scrum ceremonies, help scope sprints, and maintain close collaboration with developers and stakeholders to keep delivery aligned with product goals.
- Customer-focused analysis: I gather and synthesize user feedback and operational telemetry to propose improvements and identify opportunities for automation or simplification.
- Innovation \& design thinking: I run ideation workshops and apply iterative experiments to validate concepts and reduce risk before large investments.
- Communication \& presentation: I prepare concise, data-backed updates and present roadmaps and demos to technical and non-technical leaders.
- Tools \& analytical skills: comfortable using Excel and PowerPoint for analysis and reporting, and familiar with Visio for process and flow diagrams.

I am detail-oriented, analytically driven, and comfortable working independently or as part of a team. I enjoy asking provocative questions that reveal assumptions and open new approaches to problem solving — which aligns with your emphasis on innovation and continuous improvement.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to GM Financial’s product and innovation efforts, learn from experienced product leaders, and deliver measurable improvements as part of an Agile team. Thank you for considering my application; I am available for the full internship period and can provide references or a short portfolio of recent projects upon request.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
