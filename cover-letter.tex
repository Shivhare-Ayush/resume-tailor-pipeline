Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineering Intern, iOS position for Summer 2026. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected December 2026) and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Robinhood's mission to democratize finance.

Robinhood's Apple Design Award-winning mobile experience and focus on product excellence align with my passion for building high-quality, user-centered applications. While my primary experience is in backend engineering and Python-based systems, I have strong fundamentals in software architecture, UI/UX collaboration, and building production-ready features end-to-end. I have worked closely with product designers and cross-functional teams to deliver polished, user-facing experiences. At Potion Cast I built a real-time conversational AI backend, optimizing for responsiveness and implementing production observability—skills that translate directly to building smooth, stable iOS features. At Nebula Labs I contributed to platform work serving 40,000+ users, implementing CI/CD and collaborating with product teams to ensure high-quality releases.

I am eager to dive deep into Swift, UIKit, and the iOS ecosystem. I bring strong problem-solving skills, a product-first mindset, and experience owning features from design feedback through implementation and launch. I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and am motivated by the opportunity to work on products that empower millions of users to take control of their financial futures.

I am available for the full Summer 2026 internship period and ready to work in-person at the Menlo Park office at least three days per week. I am excited about the chance to join Robinhood's high-performing team and contribute to building the future of finance. I can provide transcripts, code samples, and references upon request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Ayush Shivhare
